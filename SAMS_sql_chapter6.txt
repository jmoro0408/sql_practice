##Chapter 6

Q1. Write a SQL statement to retrieve the product name (prod_name) and description (prod_desc) from the Products table, returning only products where the word toy is in the description.



Q2. Now let’s flip things around. Write a SQL statement to retrieve the product name (prod_name) and description (prod_desc) from the Products table, returning only products where the word toy doesn’t appear in the description. And this time, sort the results by product name.



Q3. Write a SQL statement to retrieve the product name (prod_name) and description (prod_desc) from the Products table, returning only products where both the words toy and carrots appear in the description. There are a couple of ways to do this, but for this challenge use AND and two LIKE comparisons.



Q4. This next one is a little trickier. I didn’t show you this syntax specifically, but see if you can figure it out anyway based on what you have learned thus far. Write a SQL statement to retrieve the product name (prod_name) and description (prod_desc) from the Products table, returning only products where both the words toy and carrots appear in the description in that order (the word toy before the word carrots). Here’s a hint, you’ll only need one LIKE with 3 % symbols to do this.
