##Chapter 5
Q1. Write a SQL statement to retrieve the vendor name (vend_name) from the Vendors table, returning only vendors in California (this requires filtering by both country (USA) and state (CA), after all, there could be a California outside of the USA). Here’s a hint, the filter requires matching strings.

SELECT vend_name
FROM Vendors
WHERE vend_country = 'USA' AND vend_state = 'CA'


Q2. Write a SQL statement to find all orders where at least 100 of items BR01, BR02, or BR03 were ordered. You’ll want to return order number (order_num), product id (prod_id), and quantity for the OrderItems table, filtering by both the product id and quantity. Here’s a hint, depending on how you write your filter, you may need to pay special attention to order of evaluation.

SELECT order_num, prod_id, quantity
FROM OrderItems
WHERE (prod_id IN ('BR01', 'BR02', 'BR03')) AND quantity >= 100


Q3. Now let’s revisit a challenge from the previous lesson. Write a SQL statement which returns the product name (prod_name) and price (prod_price) from Products for all products priced between 3 and 6. Use an AND, and sort the results by price.


SELECT prod_name, prod_price
FROM Products
WHERE prod_price BETWEEN 3 AND 6 
ORDER BY prod_price
