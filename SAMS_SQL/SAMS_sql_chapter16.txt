##Chapter 16

Q1. USA State abbreviations should always be in upper case. Write a SQL statement to update all USA addresses, both vendor states (vend_state in Vendors) and customer states (cust_state in Customers) so that they are upper case.

UPDATE Vendors
SET vend_state = UPPER(vend_state)
WHERE vend_country = 'USA';

UPDATE Customers
SET cust_state = UPPER(cust_state)
WHERE vend_country = 'USA';

Q2. In Lesson 15 Challenge 1 I asked you to add yourself to the Customers table. Now delete yourself. Make sure to use a WHERE clause (and test it with a SELECT before using it in DELETE) or youâ€™ll delete all customers!


DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE cust_name = 'John Doe';
