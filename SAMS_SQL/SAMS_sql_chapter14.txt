##Chapter 14

Q1. Write a SQL statement that combines two SELECT statements that retrieve product id (prod_id) and quantity from the OrderItems table, one filtering for rows with a quantity of exactly 100, and the other filtering for products with an ID that begins with BNBG. Sort the results by product id.

SELECT prod_id, quantity
FROM OrderItems
WHERE quantity = 100
UNION
SELECT prod_id, quantity
FROM OrderItems
WHERE prod_id LIKE 'BNBG%'
ORDER BY prod_id

Q2.Rewrite the SQL statement you just created to use a single SELECT statement.


SELECT prod_id, quantity
FROM OrderItems
WHERE (quantity = 100) OR (prod_id LIKE 'BNBG%')
ORDER BY prod_id

Q3. This one is a little nonsensical, I know, but it does reinforce a note earlier in this lesson. Write a SQL statement which returns and combines product name (prod_name) from Products and customer name (cust_name) from Customers, and sort the result by product name.

SELECT prod_name
FROM Products
UNION 
SELECT cust_name
FROM Customers
ORDER BY prod_name
