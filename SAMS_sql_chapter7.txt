##Chapter 7

Q1. A common use for aliases is to rename table column fields in retrieved results (perhaps to match specific reporting or client needs). Write a SQL statement that retrieves vend_id, vend_name, vend_address, and vend_city from Vendors, renaming vend_name to vname, vend_city to vcity, and vend_address to vaddress. Sort the results by vendor name (you can use the original name or the renamed name).

SELECT vend_id, 
vend_name AS vname, 
vend_address AS vaddress, 
vend_city AS vcity
FROM Vendors
ORDER BY vname

Q2. Our example store is running a sale and all products are 10% off. Write a SQL statement that returns prod_id, prod_price, and sale_price from the Products table. sale_price is a calculated field that contains, well, the sale price. Hereâ€™s a hint, you can multiply by 0.9 to get 90% of the original value (and thus the 10% off price).

SELECT prod_id, prod_price, 0.9*prod_price AS sale_price
FROM Products
